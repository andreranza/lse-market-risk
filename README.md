# lse-market-risk

In this repository you will find the project I carried out in R for the course "ME317 - Statistical methods in risk management" which I attended at the London School of Economics in London during the 2019 summer.
The script "market_risk_proj_definitive.R" is a synthesis of the tasks performed in the scripts numbered from 1 to 6. 
A final report of the analysis is provided in "REPORT_LSE".
